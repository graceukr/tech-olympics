Case Interview Question: Part Two

Mixed Call Volume

You are given the following information:
    • The total number of calls per hour is 2000.
    • The mix of sales and support calls can vary, with two possible cases:
        1 1200 Sales Calls, 800 Support Calls
        2 800 Sales Calls, 1200 Support Calls
    • There are two types of employees:
        1 Generalists who handle 10 calls per hour and are paid $10 per hour.
        2 Specialists who handle 25 calls per hour and are paid $20 per hour.

Question:
    • How many generalists and specialists should be employed for each of the two possible call distributions?

Answer:
    2000 per hour total calls
    generalists (G): 10 calls/hour, 10/hour
    - 10 calls/$10 = 1 call/dollar
    specialists (S): 25 calls/hour, 20/hour
    - 25 calls/$20 = 1.25 calls/dollar
    *specialists are more efficient:  employ as many as possible

    10G + 25S >= 2000
    cost = 10G + 20S

    Scenario 1: 1200 Sales Calls, 800 Support Calls (2000 total calls)
    2000 / 25 = 80 specialists
    0 generalists 
    80 specialists
    cost: 1600/hour

    Scenario 2: 800 Sales Calls, 1200 Support Calls (2000 total calls)
    2000 / 25 = 80 specialists
    0 generalists
    80 specialists
    total cost: 1600/hour
