Case Interview Question: Part One

50/50 Call Volume Split

You are given the following information:
    • The total number of calls per hour is 2000.
    • Calls are evenly split between sales and support (50/50 split).
    • There are two types of employees:
        ◦ Generalists who handle 10 sales calls per hour and are paid $10 per hour.
        ◦ Specialists who handle 25 support calls per hour and are paid $20 per hour.

Question:
    • How many generalists and specialists should be employed to handle the 50/50 call split efficiently?

Answer:
    2000 per hour total calls
    1000 sales calls, 1000 support calls
    generalists (G): 10 calls/hour, 10/hour
    - 10 calls/$10 = 1 call/dollar
    specialists (S): 25 calls/hour, 20/hour
    - 25 calls/$20 = 1.25 calls/dollar

    1000 sales calls: 1000 calls/ 10 calls per generalist = 100 generalists
    1000 sales calls: 1000 calls/ 25 calls per generalist = 40 generalists
    
    Employ 100 specialists and 40 generalists.
