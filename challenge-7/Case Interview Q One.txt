    • There are two types of employees:
        ◦ Generalists who handle 10 calls per hour and are paid $10 per hour.
        ◦ Specialists who handle 25 calls per hour and are paid $20 per hour.

Question:
    • How many generalists and specialists should be employed to handle the 50/50 call split efficiently?

Answer:
    2000 per hour total calls
    1000 sales calls 1000 support calls
    generalists (G): 10 calls/hour, 10/hour
    - 10 calls/$10 = 1 call/dollar
    specialists (S): 25 calls/hour, 20/hour
    - 25 calls/$20 = 1.25 calls/dollar

    2000 / 25 = 80 specialists
    Employ 80 specialists and 0 generalists because specialists are more efficient
