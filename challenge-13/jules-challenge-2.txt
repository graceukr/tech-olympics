def mystery(n):

                return 1    
        return n * mystery(n - 1)    

print(mystery(5) // mystery(3))

What will the output of the following Python code be? What is the time complexity?

ANSWER:
The output is 20
The time complexity is O(n) 
- each call to mystery(n) makes one recursive call to mystery(n-1)
- makes recursive call until it reaches the base case of n = 0
- input size n, function makes n recursive calls, gives us a time of complexity of O(n)
