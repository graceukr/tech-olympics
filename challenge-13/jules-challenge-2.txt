def mystery(n):    
        if n == 0:    
                return 1    
        return n * mystery(n - 1)    

print(mystery(5) // mystery(3))

What will the output of the following Python code be? What is the time complexity?

ANSWER:
output:
mystery(5) = 5*4*3*2*1*1 = 120 
mystery(3) = 3*2*2*1 = 6
mystery(5) // mystery(3) = 120//6 = 20

time complexity: 
O(n) 
- each call to mystery(n) makes one recursive call to mystery(n-1)
- makes recursive call until it reaches the base case of n = 0
- input size n, function makes n recursive calls, gives us a time of complexity of O(n)
