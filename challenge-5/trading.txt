A stock is currently trading at $100. 
You are a market maker and must quote both a bid (buy) 
and an ask (sell) price. If your goal is to make a profit 
from the spread while minimizing risk, how would you set your 
bid and ask prices?

answer: 
You should set your bid slighly under the current trading price of 100 dollars and the ask price slightly
above question the current trading price. This would create a narrow spread which minimizes risk because 
it helps you trade more often, avoid holding too much stock, and keeps prices competitive.
