You and another trader can either cooperate (both bid conservatively) 
or compete (aggressively bid). If both cooperate, you each earn $5M. 
If one competes and the other doesn’t, the aggressive trader earns $8M 
and the other earns $2M. If both compete, you each earn $3M. 
What’s the Nash equilibrium?

Answer: 
From what I understand, Nash equilibrium states that cooperating will 
always benefit both the most, so if you compete against each other 
the net benefit for both parties will not be greater than if you 
both cooperate. However, one party has the opportunity to earn more 
than if they were to cooperate if they choose to agressively bid. The nash 
equilibirum for this problem is both traders competing and they both each earning 3M.
